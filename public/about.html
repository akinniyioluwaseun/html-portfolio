<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">As a full-stack web developer, I take pride in owning both the frontend and backend of any project I touch. 
    I write clean, scalable code that serves a clear purpose—whether I’m building RESTful APIs, 
    designing responsive user interfaces, or managing databases. 
    I understand that the frontend is the user’s first impression, so I make sure my interfaces aren’t just functional, 
    but intuitive and visually polished. I use frameworks like React for structure, Tailwind for sleek styling, 
    and I ensure everything is responsive across devices. When I build, I focus on experience—because a smooth UI is just 
    as important as solid logic.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">On the backend, I architect systems that are efficient, secure, and ready to scale. 
      I’m comfortable working with Node.js, Express, SQL or NoSQL databases, and deploying with tools like Docker or cloud platforms.
      I structure my endpoints thoughtfully and keep performance in mind, optimizing queries and reducing bottlenecks like a pro. 
      I write tests, handle authentication, and never forget about error handling—because I know that robust infrastructure is the
      backbone of any serious application. I think in terms of data flow and functionality, always ensuring the backend 
      integrates seamlessly with the frontend.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">What sets me apart is how I manage the full lifecycle of development. 
    I don’t just code—I plan, test, debug, refactor, and deploy. I work like a product owner, always thinking about how the 
    features I build serve the user and the system as a whole. I keep my codebase clean and modular, 
    version-controlled with Git, and documented for clarity. Whether I’m working solo or collaborating with a team, 
    I bring structure, efficiency, and creativity to every build. I thrive on solving complex problems end-to-end, 
    and I take full responsibility for delivering apps that are not only functional but exceptional.</p>
